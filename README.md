Dnd Character Gen program(Work in Progress)

A program which allows the creation of a Level 1 character from Dungeons and Dragons. It means you can select the Race and Class and enter 
the information required at character generation. This information can then be saved for future reference.
The program also allows for the viewing of character details which have already been saved.
